[MT Power Drum Kit](https://www.powerdrumkit.com/) is a free drum sampler offering the powerful, high-quality sounds of an acoustic, realistic drum kit. Samples have been specially recorded and processed to make them ideally suited for use in pop, rock and metal productions.

There are some configs I've been using recently with a unconfigured (default octaves) [Akai MPK mini mk2](http://www.akaipro.com/products/keyboard-controllers/mpk-mini-mkii). 

- `drumpads-basic` maps to G#2-D#3.

- `drumkeys-basic` maps to C4-C5 (double kick and double snare)

If you have any other configuration that works for you better (independently of the device), feel free to open a pull request.
