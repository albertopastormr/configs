There are some themes that I've used in the past or I'm using at the moment. The installation of these themes in Reaper shouldn't give any problem, you just need to drag & drop a `.reaperthemezip` file into Reaper to change the default theme. There are [some documentation about Reaper thems](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/walter/index.php) and [a quick tutorial](https://reaperblog.net/2012/08/quick-theme-install/) to do this.
